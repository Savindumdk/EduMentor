The hippocampus processes new memories, then transfers them to neocortex for long-term storage during sleep. Spaced repetition exploits the 'spacing effect' - memories get stronger each time you successfully retrieve them with increasing intervals. Active recall forces your brain to reconstruct information, strengthening neural pathways. Emotion and visualization create stronger memory traces than abstract concepts alone.",

Brain seeks immediate mood repair (social media) over long-term goals. Prefrontal cortex (rational planning) vs. limbic system (immediate gratification) - limbic often wins. Procrastination creates MORE anxiety (guilt + looming deadline), creating vicious cycle. Task aversion has specific causes: 1) Task too vague ('study biology' - what exactly?), 2) Too large (feels impossible), 3) Unpleasant (boring/hard), 4) Fear of failure (if I don't try, I didn't really fail), 5) Perfectionism (can't start until conditions perfect).

Intelligence formula: Intelligence = Effort × Strategy × Time. You control 2/3 of that equation. Imposter syndrome paradox: often affects high achievers most because they set high standards. Dunning-Kruger effect: incompetent people overestimate skills, competent people underestimate - if you doubt yourself, you're probably better than you think. Confidence is built, not born with.

    "explanation": "Focus is controlled by your prefrontal cortex (executive function) and attention networks (dorsal and ventral). When you concentrate, your brain suppresses irrelevant stimuli through a process called 'selective attention'. Each distraction forces a 'context switch' - your brain must save current task state, load new task, then reload original task (23 min average cost). Modern digital environments exploit your brain's novelty-seeking dopamine circuits, making sustained focus harder. However, attention is like a muscle - it strengthens with training. Flow state (optimal focus) occurs when challenge matches skill level and distractions are minimized. Sleep, glucose levels, and stress hormones all affect focus capacity.",

      "**Pomodoro Mastery**: Set timer for 25 min. ONE task only. When mind wanders, gently redirect. After 4 pomodoros (2 hrs), take 15-30 min break. Track completed pomodoros daily",
      "**Deep Work Block**: 9am-11am = Deep Work (hardest cognitive task). Phone in another room. Email/Slack closed. Door shut. Just you and the work. 11am-12pm = Shallow work (emails, admin)",
      "**Environment Design**: Study desk = work only (no phone, games, food). Consistent location trains brain. Library desk, coffee shop table, or home office - but ONE place = ONE task",
      "**Digital Minimalism**: Phone on airplane mode during focus sessions. Delete social media apps (use browser with site blockers). Batch check email 3x daily (9am, 1pm, 5pm)",
      "**Attention Training**: Practice 'Just One Breath' - when distracted, take one mindful breath before redirecting. Builds metacognitive awareness of distraction patterns",
      "**Pre-Focus Ritual**: Clear desk → Close tabs → Put phone away → Glass of water → Set timer → Write down 'I will [specific task]' → Begin. Ritual signals brain to focus",
      "**Energy Management**: Hardest tasks when energy peaks (morning for most). Routine tasks when tired. Glucose dip at 3pm - have apple/nuts, not sugar crash",
      "**Accountability Partner**: Study video call with friend - both on mute, cameras on. Social pressure + community = doubled focus duration"
